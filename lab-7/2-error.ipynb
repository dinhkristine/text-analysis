In this case, the true values are really similar to the predicted values with all of the categories (GVIO, GSPO, GPOL, and GJOB) have a proportion of being true of higher than .94. This makes the predicted values that are differfent than true values to be really low. For example, about 9% of the time GVIO will be misclassified as GPOL. On the other hand, GJOB will never be misclassified as GSPO.   "

       "\"Documents missing on chemicals in Gulf - report. The U.S. Defence Department said nearly all the classified documents recording incidents of chemical weapons use during the Gulf war are missing despite an exhaustive search, the New York Times reported on Friday. The paper said copies of the logs were kept in safes at two U.S. locations, but a new report from the Defence Department indicates only 36 pages out of an estimated 200 have been found in a search by its investigators. The missing logs include those for eight days in March 1991 when U.S. troops unknowingly blew up chemical weapons in an Iraqi arms dump, the paper said. Those logs, which were maintained for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were first reported missing in December. Friday's paper said the new report heightens speculation about a cover-up or criminal incompetence within the Defence Department, which had denied the existence of such records before agreeing last year to release them to a veterans' group. It said the logs were recorded on floppy disks and on paper and shipped to the headquarters of the United States Central Command in Tampa, Florida. A separate computer disk containing the information was stored at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland, but nearly all the information at both sites has vanished, the Times said. The paper said the Defence Department gave its report to the Senate Armed Services Committee this month but had not yet planned to release it to the public.\""

       "'China to approve Shell petchem joint venture soon. China\\'s executive vice chairman of state planning Ye Qing on Friday said he expected the Chinese authorities soon to approve a major joint venture project to build a petrochemical plant with Shell in Guangdong province. \"I saw the managing director of Shell two days ago and I told him that I personally and the state commission will approve this project very soon,\" Ye told reporters in Paris at a press conference following an International Energy Agency ministerial meeting. The project to build a petrochemical plant is a joint venture with the state China National Offshore Oil Corporation and has been under discussion since 1971 Ye said the plants was expected to produce 85 million tonnes a year of ethylene, having been raised from previous plans for 45 million tonnes of annual capacity. Ye also said that plans for a refinery at the same site remained on hold. \"To ensure a better return for the project we have decided not to build a refinery at the same time but to import\" petroleum projects to supply the petrochemical complex, he said. The original project had been valued at $6 billion, including the originally-projected 160,000 barrels per day oil refinery. A spokesman for Shell in London declined to comment on Ye Qing\\'s statement.'"

       "'Australian Jews scan Swiss Holocaust bank list. Hundreds of relatives of Jewish Holocaust victims living in Australia could be eligible for funds in Swiss banks after the publication of more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, Jewish officials said on Wednesday. While only four Australian names were on the list, Australia boasts the world\\'s fourth largest Jewish population, due to large scale post-World War Two migration. \"There are more Jews of Polish decent living in Australia than there are Jews living in Poland,\" said Jeremy Jones, spokesman for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \"There could potentially be hundreds (of relatives) on this list, but we do not believe that this list is comprehensive or exhaustive. This is the list from the Swiss banks: it is not a list discovered by any independent audit,\" Jones told Reuters. The Swiss Bankers Association took out a double-page advertisement in The Australian national newspaper, listing more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, including assets by Holocaust victims. The list included four Australian men. \"We imagine of the thousands of names many of those will not have any living relatives because of the extent of the Nazi genocide,\" Jones said. However, Jones said the publication of the list will make it easier for relatives of Holocaust victims to claim funds. Swiss bank sources on Tuesday said the total amount in dormant accounts was around US$40 million rather than US$29 million as the banks said last year. \"They are now saying we have this list and the issue is proving a relationship, which is easier,\" Jones said. \"We certainly hope this is an indication that the Swiss banks will no longer demand every receipt and deposit slip and every account number,\" he said. Jones said Australian Jews had mixed feelings about the publication of the list. \"We are happy, but why has it taken 52 years to happen. There has been a large level abrogation of morality,\" he said. On Saturday, a Sydney Jewish family said it had made a successful claim for funds belonging to a Holocaust victim held in a Swiss bank. The deal was done three weeks ago in Zurich between Sydney accountant Stephen Baruch and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Baruch told Reuters. The Australian newspaper reported Jewish community sources saying the amount, based on an original deposit of 600 pounds sterling in 1938, was now worth more than US$154,000. Baruch said that was an exaggeration.'"

      "U.S. concerned by Wang Dan sentence. The United States on Wednesday expressed deep concern over the prison term given to Chinese dissident Wang Dan and said Secretary of State Warren Christopher would discuss the case in Beijing next month. \"We urge the Chinese authorities to show clemency to this courageous man, whose championing of democratic values has gained him deserved international recognition,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. A Beijing court on Wednesday sentenced Wang to 11 years in prison and said the 27-year-old former student leader would be deprived of his political rights for a further two years for plotting to subvert the government. \"We are deeply concerned by the sentence that has been given to Wang Dan,\" White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. \"He is one of the premier voices in China for human rights and workers' rights, expressing his own opinion, which he is freely entitled to do under the universal declaration of human rights,\" McCurry added. \"It is inconceivable that any government would seek to restrict the ability of someone to raise those issues in a climate of freedom of expression.\" McCurry said President Bill Clinton and Christopher had previously raised Wang's case with the Chinese government and \"expressed their concern both about his incarceration and about the unfairness and injustice done to him by his inability to freely express his own views.\" \"We continue to stress that we believe that freedom of expression as recognised by the declaration on human rights is the hallmark of any civil society,\" he added. At the State Department, Burns said that despite the sentencing, Christopher would go forward with a trip to China on Nov. 18-20. Christopher's last trip to Beijing two years ago was marred by friction over human rights. \"The secretary has raised human rights concerns in ... all of his 14 meetings, with Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. And he will certainly raise our concerns about this case and others when he is in Beijing and Shanghai in mid-November,\" he said. But Burns, arguing that isolating China has not had a positive effect on human rights there, added: \"We believe that we need to engage directly with the Chinese leadership on all the issues in our relationship -- human rights, trade issues, political issues, security issues.\" Wang, one of the student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing that were crushed by the army, disappeared into detention in May 1995. He had faced a maximum penalty of death and a minumum 10-year prison term. Prior to his incarceration, he had been one of the few members of China's dwindling band of dissidents not in exile or serving a long term in detention or prison. His family denounced Wednesday's verdict and said it would be appealed.\n",

      "Sweden may send Palme investigator to South Africa. Sweden said on Friday it may send detectives to South Africa to interview a man who has said an apartheid police spy was behind the assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme 10 years ago. Acting state prosecutor and Palme murder investigation leader Solveig Riberdahl told Reuters: \"It might mean sending a member of the Palme commission or a police representative (to South Africa).   \"It's hard to make any proper evaluation of this information in the first place, but the fact that de Kock is the former head of the South African security forces lends a different type of credibility to his story,\" she said. \"Of course, our own interview would be desirable, but we have very little experience of judicial coooperation with South Africa,\" she added. South Africa has pledged a full investigation of court testimony on Thursday by Eugene de Kock, former head of a now disbanded police hit squad, that former spy Craig Williamson was involved in the 1986 murder.\n",

      "Violence imperils Israel's plans for tourism surge. Israel's tourism industry hopes to welcome millions of visitors for the country's 50th anniversary in 1998 and the end of the millennium in 2000, but officials fret that political violence could undermine their plans. Tourism officials say they expect celebrations next year will bring a surge of Jewish visitors, followed by a flood of Christians two years later to mark the millennium. \"I expect by the year 2000 we'll see four to five million tourists in Israel,\" said Avi Rosenthal, director of the Israel Hotel Association. That would be nearly double the number Israel hosted in its peak year of 1995. But for now the $3.2 billion tourism sector is experiencing its longest slump in recent years, said Shabtai Shai, the Tourism Ministry's senior deputy director-general. That, in turn, could snag plans to build hotel rooms for the expected but far from assured wave of tourism. With just 40,000 rooms now available, the new rooms are crucial. Tourism officials estimate Israel has about 15,000 rooms in development, of which 10,000 should be ready by 2000. Together with youth hotels, guest houses and other locations, those rooms would give Israel 60,000 rooms for the millennium, Shai estimated -- enough to squeeze in four million visitors. Arrivals reached a record 2.36 million in 1995 but have been falling since early 1996, when a spate of bombings by Islamic militants and an Israeli blitz on Lebanon scared off visitors. In the first half of 1997, incoming tourist arrivals declined six percent to 1.1 million. This summer witnessed the bombing in a Jerusalem open-air market that killed 16 people including the bombers, as well as an attack on British students in Jaffa and the shooting last week of two British hitchhikers, one of whom was killed. \"It's not a major slump, but in recent years we've been used to 12 percent increases,\" said Rosenthal. Israel's hotel industry has taken a big hit. The Tourism Ministry says occupancy rates fell 13.1 percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, the latest for which figures are available, to just 51 percent. An industry source estimated the downturn deepened to 15 percent in July and August. Tourism officials say this summer's incidents alone will not have a long-term impact and tourism should bounce back next year. But continuing violence could threaten a revival. \"People tend to forget. If these are isolated incidents the impact will be minimal,\" said Shai. Rosenthal said tourist arrivals could grow 10 percent next year, putting Israel on track to greet 4.5 million visitors in 2000 -- provided there was no more major violence. Eli Verter, deputy managing director for Africa Israel Hotels and Resorts, was sceptical. \"There is not a lot of optimism,\" he said. \"Around Independence Day (April 30, 1998) there will be a lot of delegations but most of the year will be quiet.\" He said that in the volatile tourism environment it was premature to predict how many tourists would come for the millennium. Rosenthal said: \"I don't see anyone postponing or stopping plans. It's a long-term commitment. On the contrary, Marriott and Four Seasons are in negotiations to get into the country.\" Despite his caution, Verter said Africa Israel planned to add two hotels next year to its chain of eight Holiday Inns and two more in 1999. Shai was less confident about construction. \"There is no question that if there's a decline in arrivals, which is not a one-time decline, there's an impact on investment,\" he said. \"They don't cancel plans but they slow them down.\"\n",

      "Hundreds remember TWA victims at mass. One year to the day that TWA Flight 800 exploded and crashed into the sea off New York's Long Island, hundreds gathered at a memorial mass for the 230 people who perished in the disaster. Relatives and friends of the victims, colleagues of the flight crew, workers involved in the difficult recovery effort and investigators who have yet to solve the mystery of the crash sat somberly in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York. \"When the loss is so sudden and of such magnitude ... the pain we experience is ever more intense,\" said the Rev. John Ferry, the main celebrant at the memorial Mass. \"We come here this morning not to remember how they died, but more importantly to remember how they lived.\" The Roman Catholic Mass was one of at least three memorial services planned in the United States on Thursday for the 230 passengers and crew killed in the July 17, 1996 crash. The victims included citizens of the United States, several European countries and Israel. The Boeing 747 broke up in a fireball without warning just 11 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy international airport on a journey to Paris. A year later, the cause of the disaster remains a mystery. Although investigators know the nearly empty but vapor-filled center fuel tank exploded, they have not determined why. Investigators say they strongly suspect the crash occurred because of a mechanical failure rather than sabotage by bomb or missile, two of the other main theories in the probe. On this first anniversary, U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was frustrated and disappointed that the cause had not been found. \"Of course I'm disappointed that we don't conclusively know. But I'm not sure what else we can do,\" Clinton told reporters at the White House. On Thursday afternoon, New York Gov. George Pataki was scheduled to host a memorial service at Smith Point Park on Long Island near the site where the aircraft fell in thousands of pieces into the Atlantic Ocean. Another service was planned in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, home town of 16 high school French club members and five adult chaperones who died. Lead investigators Robert Francis of the National Transportation Safety Board and FBI assistant director James Kallstrom attended the Mass in New York along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Some of those attending the Mass, many of them sympathizers and even tourists who came to pay respects, wiped away tears during the hymns and prayers led by Ferry. In his remarks, Giuliani said he would never forget the moment he heard about the crash of TWA Flight 800 and he praised the families for the love they showed to those they lost in the tragedy. \"I'll never forget the love you displayed and continue to display for each other,\" Giuliani said. \"All of us in New York and America and all around the world have learned many lessons from you.\" Thursday's services and a memorial at the airport on Wednesday for TWA Flight 800's crew were among many events scheduled over five days to remember those who died or to honor the hundreds of people from government agencies or volunteers who worked in the aftermath of the disaster. A highlight of the TWA service was the unveiling of a six-foot high statue featuring three etched glass panels showing the plane taking off, being cupped gently in a pair of hands and then being transformed into a bird.\n",

      "Greek foreign minister meets Milosevic on crisis. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday to lend help in defusing Serbia's political crisis after opposition leaders dismissed apparent government concessions. The opposition movement reacted with scepticism to an apparant climbdown by the Socialist (SPS) government in a marathon dispute over annulled local elections and vowed to press on with mass demonstrations for democratic reform. Some 5,000 student protesters swarmed noisily through central Belgrade overnight after weary riot police dismantled cordons erected to enforce a ban on street marches. It was the 56th straight day of rallies protesting at the SPS's cancellation of results in Serbia-wide municipal elections won by the Zajedno (Together) opposition bloc. Pangalos had talks with the reclusive Milosevic shortly after arriving in Belgrade. There was no comment from either side afterwards and Pangalos went into a meeting with leaders of the opposition movement. \"(My) message is to try to find the way to promote normal democratic life in Serbia,\" Pangalos told reporters earlier on his arrival at Belgrade airport. \"This will help the friends of Serbia and Yugoslavia to work harder for integration of the country in the international community. That's what we're trying to achieve,\" he said. Pangalos was offering his good offices in Greece's role as a traditional friend of Serbian-led Yugoslavia, with which it shares the Christian Orthodox faith. In a possible breakthrough on Saturday, two deputy Serbian prime ministers issued a joint statement with protesting students after a meeting calling for \"genuine and final\" results in the elections to be honoured. \"The Serbian government representatives agreed with the necessity that the will of the citizens expressed at local elections must be fully respected,\" said the statement signed by deputy prime ministers Ratko Markovic and Nedeljko Sipovac and a delegation of Belgrade University students. Vuk Draskovic, a Zajedno leader, said the deputy prime ministers' statement was \"a belated step toward reason\". But he and other Zajedno leaders accused Milosevic of scheming to outmanoeuvre the opposition with empty concessions, including rumoured offers of posts in the government, that would not affect the Socialists' dominant position. Zajedno promised to keep protesting until its election wins were redeemed in full and broad democratic reforms begun. The hardline SPS city board in Nis gave room for opposition suspicions by rejecting a Serbian Justice Ministry finding last week that Zajedno had won the voting in that city after all. Greece has avoided taking sides in the political duel between the Socialists and Zajedno. But the European Union, to which Greece belongs, has blasted Milosevic's failure to explicitly concede opposition victories in the elections and demanded he do so or forgo financial aid and remain internationally isolated. The opposition movement has surged amid discontent with SPS corruption and mismanagement of a state-run economy that crumbled under U.N. sanctions imposed to punish Serbia for instigating the war in Bosnia. Most sanctions were rescinded last year but Yugoslavia has not been re-admitted to international institutions yet. Zajedno's victories in 14 of Serbia's 18 largest cities including the capital Belgrade and second largest city Nis were cancelled by the SPS over alleged \"irregularities\". An OSCE investigation declared the elections valid, intensifying pressure on the Socialists to back down.\n",

      "Gazan professor arrested by PLO over exam - wife. Palestinian security forces have arrested a university professor in Gaza for including questions in a final exam that embarrassed the Palestinian Authority, his wife said on Thursday. A spokesman for the Preventive Security Service in Gaza said Fatehi Suboh, a professor of education at al-Azhar university, was arrested on Wednesday and \"was being interrogated over certain allegations\" which he did not specify. Suboh's wife, Fatma, said her husband had posed questions in the exam asking about alleged mismanagement in the Palestinian Authority and the university. \"He was arrested for putting those questions in the final exam,\" she told Reuters. The security service spokesman denied the allegation. Suboh, a longtime critic of the way al-Azhar is run, was suspended a week ago by the university, which is effectively controlled by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\n",

      "US arrests Algerian Islamic militant. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalisation Service on Saturday confirmed that it has detained an Algerian Islamic militant who was reportedly seeking political asylum in the United States. INS spokesman Russ Bergeron, confirming a report in Sunday editions of the Washington Post, said Anwar Haddam was arrested on Dec. 6, a day after the expiration of the \"parole\" status that allowed him to remain legally in the United States. Haddam, who came to the United States in 1992 and has since served as a U.S.-based spokesman for Algeria's Islamic Salvation Front, had applied for political asylum, according to the Post. Bergeron, citing U.S. privacy laws, could not confirm that Haddam had been seeking asylum, but said his \"petition\" had been denied by an immigration court on Oct. 3. He also could give no reason why the petition was denied. Haddam was among 188 Islamic militants who won seats in Algeria's legislature in the first round of an election in December 1991. The Algerian army then intervened to cancel a runoff in January 1992, preventing a victory by the Islamic Salvation Front, also known as the FIS. The government outlawed the group and jailed or exiled its members, including Haddam. Haddam initially fled to France, which expelled him in 1992. He faces arrests if he returns to either France or Algeria. Bergeron said Haddam had appeared twice before an immigration court, but his case had been continued. Eventually, an immigration court will have to decide whether Haddam should be expelled, he said. Haddam is married and has four children, three of whom are U.S. citizens because they were born here, Bergeron said. Haddam is renewing his request for political asylum from his cell at an INS detention facility, the Post reported. It said he had also been served with a civil lawsuit by seven Algerian and French plaintiffs who are seeking unspecified damages for \"crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other gross human rights and humanitarian law violations.\" The plaintiffs accused Haddam and the FIS of involvement in assassinations, torture, hijacking, sexual violence against women and sex-based apartheid, the Post reported.\n",

      "Mozambique meeting urges ban on landmines. Four hundred delegates at an international conference in Mozambique agreed on Friday to urge their governments to sign a treaty in Ottawa in December banning landmines. The fourth International NGO (non-governmental organisation) conference, whose delegates came mostly from Africa and Europe, aimed at building support for the treaty banning landmines. A final statement at the end of the week-long conference urged regional groups such as the Organisation of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to follow the lead of South Africa and Mozambique which have announced unilateral bans on landmines this month. A representative of the Swaziland government said it would sign the treaty in December. Malawi said it also supported a total ban and is waiting for parliament's approval. Tanzania's foreign ministry said in a letter to the conference it would urge all of SADC's 12 members, of which it is also a partner, to sign a protocol banning anti-personnel landmines. Zimbabwe's government said it no longer manufactured landmines and planned to make a formal statement on a landmine ban shortly. South Africa's President Nelson Mandela said in a letter to the conference that his government \"wants to work with others to ensure the earliest possible conclusion of a ban treaty\". \"We are very encouraged by the steps taken by Swaziland and Malawi, but disappointed by Zimbabwe and Angola not taking a stronger stance,\" said Jody Williams, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. \"For a mine-free southern Africa we especially need the full commitment of mine-fested countries,\" she added. Princess Diana recently visited Angola, which has an estimated 12 million mines, to support the British Red Cross in its campaign to ban anti-personnal mines. The statement at the end of the conference appealed to the international community to increase resources for mine clearance and assistance to survivors, especially in countries and regions that have banned landmines.\n",

      "Turkish government approves Islamist crackdown. Turkey's Islamist-led government said on Thursday it would rigorously implement a crackdown on religious activism demanded by the secularist military. \"The (army's) decisions will be sincerely enforced,\" Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Istanbul stocks soared on hopes of government stability. Orders from the military-dominated National Security Council (MGK) to carry out a list of anti-Islamist demands had caused friction in Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's ruling alliance. \"The prime minister and I both gave clear orders to the relevant ministries to implement the MGK decisions in the short term, medium term and long term,\" said Ciller, head of the coalition's pro-Western wing. \"Our government is committed against the reactionary danger,\" said cabinet spokesman Lutfu Esengun, from Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP). Neither gave details of specific action the government would take. Political analysts say Erbakan should have little difficulty in giving concessions to the army on issues he does not see as directly affecting his grassroots support, like getting tough on religious extremists. But he will have problems consenting to the generals' demands that the coalition legislate against peaceful Islamist dissent and restrict the number of religious secondary schools, known as \"Imam Hatips\". Many supporters of the Welfare Party and some of Erbakan's ministers were educated at religious shcools. Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) has also encouraged religious education. \"Any compromise that ends with the closure of Imam Hatips and the abuse of human rights and freedoms will be a decree of death for the DYP and RP,\" columnist Fehmi Koru wrote in the Zaman daily, a moderate Islamist paper that often criticises Erbakan. Welfare had upset the army in recent months with plans to increase the role of Islam in public life. The generals replied with orders for a return to the rigid secularism of the 1920s, when republican Turkey was rising from the ashes of the religion-based Ottoman Empire. Other army demands include enforcing a ban on Islamic dress and halting the recent growth in Islamic brotherhoods, known as \"tarikats\". The military row has led to speculation that the military would staged its fourth coup since 1960 and has distracted from Erbakan's initial success in an ambitious privatisation programme. The Istanbul stock market's general index closed 67 points, or 4.66 percent, higher at 1,504. \"There was an overall buying activity on positive news about the cabinet meeting,\" said Serdar Karatepe from Polen securities. Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, came to power last year after narrowly winning 1995 elections with 21 percent of the vote. The secularist majority complain he has no mandate to change the country's system.\n",

      "EU wants to be more than bankroller in Middle East. The European Union, fearful of being left as a mere backroom bankroller in the Middle East peace process, is trying to muscle its way back into the picture to stop Washington grabbing all of whatever glory is on offer. But it is not only pride. Analysts say the bloc is also deeply worried that a failure of peace in the region would lead to a rise in instability along Europe's southern flank.   At a summit in Dublin on Saturday, EU leaders showed their determination to be involved in talks between Israelis and Palestinians by dispatching a hastily put-together mission to the region. Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring left on Sunday. Irish officials say he has since met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. France -- anxious to retain its historic presence in the region and traditionally wary of U.S. foreign policy engagements -- was the chief mover in the decision.   Diplomatic sources say French President Jacques Chirac was so keen to have Spring leave as early as Sunday morning that he telephoned Nethanyahu to set up the meeting. \"Europe showed in Dublin that it had things to say,\" French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette told French television. \"President Jacques Chirac and I had to insist because for the first time there was a demand.\" This was a reference to Arafat's request for EU participation in the peace process.   Conscious that the United States may be affected by the proximity of next month's presidential election and the power of the Jewish lobby, EU foreign ministers last week used their harshest language to date over the deterioration of Israeli-Palestinian relations. While foreign ministers insisted they were being even-handed, their statement made clear they believe it to be Israel's responsibility to meet commitments made in the peace process. Some diplomats said they believed the tone of the statement had been a wake-up call for the Israelis.   Foreign policy analysts say there is a deep worry in European capitals about the future in the Middle East and the bloc's role there. On one level, the EU sees that recent stalling of the peace process and the harder line taken by Israel as potentially playing into the hands of radicals in the region. \"There are some real economic and security reasons that they (EU leaders) want things to get going,\" said Shireen Hunter, visiting research fellow at the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies.   \"Given the fact that Europeans are just beginning to breathe a little more comfortably after the Algerian situation, they don't want to see anything bad happen,\" she said. The EU, worried about a flood of immigration from the Mediterranean basin and potentially agressive neighbours, has launched a number of projects to enhance security in the region. Last year, following the principle that external economic leverage would bring the required internal changes, it hosted a high-profile Mediterranean conference culminating in a pledge to create a huge free-trade zone across the basin by 2010. It is also the largest contributor to development in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, having committed 500 million Ecus ($600 million) over a five year period. But the EU also believes it must take a far bigger role in issues on its door step, like the Middle East, if it is ever to match its economic weight with political presence. \"If Europe is going to have any reality whatsoever, Europe has to act in one of the most important strategic areas,\" Hunter said. \"Otherwise Europe can't be taken seriously as a global actor.\"\n",

      "Cows' marathon march ends, breeders see Chirac. Breeders who led a herd of cows on a marathon march to Paris won a pledge from President Jacques Chirac on Friday that he would help save their livelihoods jeopardised by the mad cow crisis. While the 26 cows rested in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower after covering some 350 kms (220 miles) in three weeks, the head of state spent almost an hour and a half hearing the grievances of five breeders who praised his \"farmers' language\". \"The president told us that he wouldn't let us down but he had no magic wand,\" Pierre Grolleau, 53, told reporters. \"For the outcome, we'll see tomorrow. We're people who are not in a hurry,\" he added. \"We told him we were losing 3,000 francs ($600) per animal and he said he couldn't compensate for all the losses because of the Budget Ministry,\" said Nathalie Telemaque, 29, complaining of prices that slumped because of this year's disclosure that mad cow disease appeared to be a risk to human health. Shortly after the meeting, national statistics institute INSEE said prices for beef cattle fell another 10.2 percent in July, and were down 19 percent compared to year-earlier levels. Chirac, a conservative popular with farmers since he started out as an agriculture minister lobbying for them in Brussels, struck a charismatic note with the breeders. \"He talks like a farmer. We laughed a bit, we interrupted each other,\" Grolleau said. But the protesters from the central town of Charroux won no specific commitments or a timetable for reforms. \"He spoke of reducing overheads rather than grants. He said he would safeguard cattle-breeding on a family basis,\" Telemaque said. Chirac also discussed creating a new logo to better identify the origin of meat imports following a show of force by thousands of farmers who blockaded roads across the country before dawn on Thursday to carry out spot checks on lorries. Prime Minister Alain Juppe said later he had given Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur orders to be \"especially pugnacious\" in seeking greater European Union aid for farmers hit by the mad cow crisis. The cows did not follow their masters into the Elysee courtyard. \"It's pretty difficult to manage stock here, even though we do have stables,\" quipped one Elysee aide. Wearing jeans and sweatshirts with rolled-up sleeves, the herders were also stripped of their staffs before entering Chirac's gilded offices. Some 1,500 breeders from various regions demonstrated on the grassy Champs de Mars park near the Eiffel Tower, joining the small group of Charroux breeders. On Thursday, about 15,000 farmers blockaded roads across France, checking trucks in a protest aimed at barring imports of beef from outside the EU because of low prices caused by the mad cow crisis. Thursday's blockades were the first in a wave of social unrest expected to target the austerity-minded government in coming weeks. European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).\n",

      "Australian Jews scan Swiss Holocaust bank list. Hundreds of relatives of Jewish Holocaust victims living in Australia could be eligible for funds in Swiss banks after the publication of more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, Jewish officials said on Wednesday. While only four Australian names were on the list, Australia boasts the world's fourth largest Jewish population, due to large scale post-World War Two migration. \"There are more Jews of Polish decent living in Australia than there are Jews living in Poland,\" said Jeremy Jones, spokesman for the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \"There could potentially be hundreds (of relatives) on this list, but we do not believe that this list is comprehensive or exhaustive. This is the list from the Swiss banks: it is not a list discovered by any independent audit,\" Jones told Reuters. The Swiss Bankers Association took out a double-page advertisement in The Australian national newspaper, listing more than 2,000 pre-1945 accounts, including assets by Holocaust victims. The list included four Australian men. \"We imagine of the thousands of names many of those will not have any living relatives because of the extent of the Nazi genocide,\" Jones said. However, Jones said the publication of the list will make it easier for relatives of Holocaust victims to claim funds. Swiss bank sources on Tuesday said the total amount in dormant accounts was around US$40 million rather than US$29 million as the banks said last year. \"They are now saying we have this list and the issue is proving a relationship, which is easier,\" Jones said. \"We certainly hope this is an indication that the Swiss banks will no longer demand every receipt and deposit slip and every account number,\" he said. Jones said Australian Jews had mixed feelings about the publication of the list. \"We are happy, but why has it taken 52 years to happen. There has been a large level abrogation of morality,\" he said. On Saturday, a Sydney Jewish family said it had made a successful claim for funds belonging to a Holocaust victim held in a Swiss bank. The deal was done three weeks ago in Zurich between Sydney accountant Stephen Baruch and the Union Bank of Switzerland, Baruch told Reuters. The Australian newspaper reported Jewish community sources saying the amount, based on an original deposit of 600 pounds sterling in 1938, was now worth more than US$154,000. Baruch said that was an exaggeration.\n",

      "Palestinians in Hebron fear massacre by settlers. Adwan Jamal lives in Hebron in a house sandwiched between two heavily guarded Jewish enclaves. A Palestinian, he fears a slaughter by Jewish settlers when Israeli troops withdraw from parts of the West Bank city. \"We are afraid settlers will massacre Palestinians,\" Jamal, a 28-year-old vegetable vendor, told Reuters. Palestinians believe that once Israel and the PLO reach a long-delayed accord on an Israeli pullback, the settlers, armed and feeling besieged, will retaliate against the deal by shooting Arabs in the city. They fear that neither Palestinian police in their areas nor soldiers in Israeli areas will be able to stop the assault. Several Palestinians say people are buying weapons for self-defence. \"If attacked by Jewish settlers, Palestinians will not sit and watch, they will use all means possible to defend themselves,\" said Moussa Abu Sbeih, a Palestinian Legislative Council member. About 400 Jews live in the Hebron city centre among more than 100,000 Palestinians. Jamal and his five brothers are among the few Palestinians who did not flee al-Shuhada (Martyrs) street in the city's heart to avoid daily friction when the Jews settled nearby. \"Look at my windows, all the glass is broken by settlers who throw stones as they pass in front of the house,\" Jamal said. \"I don't dare take my sick child to hospital at night because settlers would attack us. They spit at us and curse us, and they let their dogs loose to attack our children,\" he said. According to the interim PLO-Israel deal, the heart of Hebron will remain under Israeli occupation while other parts of the city are handed over to the Palestinian Authority. The PLO and Israel have failed in negotiations night and day to launch the handover. But negotiations continue. Palestinians accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to reopen the accord signed between the PLO and the former Israeli government. While Palestinians want more protection for themselves, Netanyahu wants to ensure more security for settlers. Settlers fear an Israeli army pullback will put their lives in jeopardy. Israeli security officials worry about a possible attack by militant Moslems. \"There's going to be a war,\" said Baruch Merzel, a militant settler in Hebron, when asked what to expect from a pullout. Hebron settlers include some of the most militant Israelis on the West Bank. On Sunday, a settler fired shots at Arab houses in the heart of Hebron but no one was hurt. Some 450 Palestinian policemen this week completed a six-month training course in preparation for their deployment in Hebron after an Israeli pullout. \"We know settlers carry automatic weapons, we have seen them training in Israeli army camps near Hebron, and we are worried they will use these arms against Palestinians in the city and even against the Palestinian police,\" Brigadier-General Tarek Zeid, commander of Palestinian police in Hebron, told Reuters. \"On our side, we will deal firmly with and prevent any Arab from attacking settlers, but we hope the Israeli army will do its job by controlling these settlers,\" Zeid said. Worry plagues Palestinians who live on Shuhada street, which links two Jewish enclaves in the city centre and connects the old Arab city in Hebron with the rest of the town. Israel closed the street to Palestinian traffic in 1994 after settler Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in al-Ibrahimi mosque in the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Israel cites security reasons for keeping it closed. Palestinians say it must be reopened to restore normal life to some 20,000 Palestinians living and working there and to avoid dividing the city. \"We are terrified of what the Israeli army and the settlers will do to us after redeployment,\" Jamal's mother Zuhra said.\n",

      "Bosnian Croat refugees harass Serb villagers. Bosnian Croat refugees have expelled and abused elderly Serbs in central Croatia, threatening them with bombs and smashing windows, Serbs and human rights monitors said on Thursday. Milorad Pupovac, a Serb civic leader and member of the Croatian parliament, said more than 100 men attacked three villages in the Banovina region south of Zagreb on Tuesday night, \"beating the villagers and destroying their property\". Some Serbs were beaten by the Bosnian Croats, who included men in military uniform, added Ivan Cicak, who heads human rights monitoring group Helsinki Watch in Croatia. Lovre Pejkovic, head of the government office for displaced persons, said problems started when eight to 10 Serbs, who fled the village of Bijelovac in 1995, returned there on Tuesday wihtout notifying the police or the municipal authorities. \"We don't want to prevent the return of Serbs but there must be a legal procedure,\" Pejkovic told Reuters in the nearby municipal town of Kostajnica on Thursday. Milan Veljaca, 69, said a group of men he could not identify threw stones at his house in Umetici, another Serb village, while he and his wife were asleep. \"One of them shouted 'Come out or I'll throw a bomb',\" he told Reuters. \"One guy hit me in the head with a hammer and slapped me. Another stripped my wife's clothes from her,\" he said, standing by the shattered windows of his house. \"They shouted: 'What are you waiting for? This is not Serbian land, this is Croatian.'\" Veljaca, who had a bandage around his head and cuts on his leg, returned to his village from Serbia in January. He and his wife were taken to a hospital by ambulance. A police inspector said about 100 houses were attacked. \"It always happens after dark,\" he added. Before the 1991-95 wars in Croatia and Bosnia, about two-thirds of the population in the area was Serb, the rest Croat. Kostajnica police chief Zeljko Bolcevic told Reuters that three Croats had been arrested but later released as the incident qualified only as a misdemeanour. \"There were individual cases of verbal abuse and quarrels with the local Serb population. But there was no organised expulsion,\" he said. \"Some (Serbs) left in fear, but that was not necessary, we would have protected them as we have done so far.\" About a thousand ethnic Croats expelled from Bosnia by Serb troops and resettled by the Croatian government in former Serb houses around Kostajnica protested on Thursday against the return of original Serb residents. Marko Matic, a 23-year-old Croat from Posavina in northern Bosnia, lost a kidney after being badly beaten by Serbs in 1991 and said he would never live alongside Serbs. \"Some came back from Serbia -- Serbs, chetniks (ultra-nationalists), animals who killed our people. They said 20,000 Serbs will come back,\" he said. \"Are we here only to clean the houses for the Serbs so they can move back in?\" He was referring to Croatian government plans to orchestrate a mass resettlement of displaced people, moving Serbs out of Eastern Slavonia to their pre-war homes, to allow Croats to return. Eastern Slavonia enclave is now administered by the United Nations under a mandate expiring on July 15. It will then become part of Croatia proper and revert to Zagreb's control. \"This one incident encapsulates some of the larger problems we have,\" said Phil Arnold, U.N. spokesman in the enclave. \"Every activity like this slows down the return of Croatian displaced persons into Eastern Slavonia,\" he told Reuters. The United States, which Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic is now visiting, voiced concern over Croatia's attitude to the issue. \"We support the right of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes...from which they were driven during the war, and we are concerned that Croatia has not taken the steps necessary to facilitate the return of the ethnic Serb refugees to Croatia,\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.\n",

      "U.S. seen calm for now despite Japan surplus rise. Turmoil in Asian currencies and prospects of few rewards to reap from a trade war mean the United States will likely stay calm, at least for now, despite Japan's growing trade surplus, analysts say. But behind closed doors, U.S. officials will keep up pressure on Tokyo to ensure its tight fiscal stance does not derail Japan's recovery and cause its surplus to balloon. \"They can still say things to the Japanese, it's just a question of whether they go on TV or not to say it,\" said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings in Tokyo. Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus recorded another hefty jump in July, rising 70 percent to 849 billion yen ($7.25 billion). Tokyo's trade gap with the United States alone grew 36 percent to 421 billion yen ($3.59 billion), according to data released on Monday. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang reiterated Washington's concern about the rising trend after the data was released, but added he had not discussed the trade surplus in talks with a Finance Ministry official on Monday morning. U.S. trade officials led by Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky have been sounding the alarm about Japan's yawning trade gap and accusing Tokyo of failing to honour a 1995 pact on greater access to its automotive market. But U.S. Treasury mandarins have kept their comments relatively bland. A meeting between Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara last week yielded only a statement that the two discussed a \"range of issues, including the U.S.-Japan relationship, events in Thailand, and cooperation in Asia\". Summers and Sakakibara -- the latter known as \"Mr Yen\" for his ability to sway markets with his remarks -- discussed currencies. But the two sides said there had been no change in the two nations' foreign exchange rate policies. Economists say that for now, key Washington policy-makers feel they have little to gain from a high profile attack on Japanese economic policies at a time when Tokyo has taken the lead in forging a bailout package aimed at easing a financial crisis in Thailand and countering regional currency turmoil. Donors led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Japan last week hammered out a $16.7 billion rescue package for Thailand, but worries remain that Bangkok may need more loans. Japan and the IMF each kicked in $4 billion. Washington supported the package but made no individual contribution. \"Obviously, they (the U.S.) want to be as non-destabilising as possible and the best way to do that is to keep their mouth shut,\" said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. Such considerations may keep Treasury officials' relatively quiet, at least until after the IMF meeting in Hong Kong in late September, some economists said. Worries about jittery U.S. markets after last week's steep falls in New York share prices could also make U.S. officials wary of jolting currency markets with hawkish trade comments. \"If Treasury is quiet, it's because they don't want to rock currency markets...when U.S. stocks and bonds are already rocked,\" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at CS First Boston in Tokyo. Japanese officials say the trade surplus is not set for a period of drastic expansion, and that any problems on the automotive front are due to lacklustre efforts by Detroit's \"Big Three\" car makers. U.S. trade officials, however, will doubtless keep voicing their concern in response to domestic industry worries about rising Japanese exports. \"The USTR is acting as the sole agent to express grievances over Japan's trade surplus while others keep quiet,\" Sasaki-Smith said. \"Inevitably Japan's trade surplus will be on the mind of U.S. decision-makers,\" she added. \"They don't want to politicise it...but in reality it is very much on their minds.\" Washington's public patience, however, could well wear thin if Japan's exports keep rising while its domestic economy sputters due to higher taxes and lower public spending. \"Japan's current account surplus is going to go over three percent of GDP (gross domestic product), probably in the January-March quarter of 1998,\" Salomon's Feldman said. \"Exchange rates could move in a rather dramatic fashion.\" ($1=117 yen)\n",

      "Most Israelis fear outbreak of war - poll. Sixty percent of Israelis fear the outbreak of a Middle East war, according to an opinion poll published on Wednesday. A Panorama Marketing Institute poll published in the Israeli daily Maariv found that Israelis are increasingly apprehensive about the future. Only 37 percent believed their country was on the right track, down from 48 percent in a similar poll released four months ago. Thirty-seven percent of the survey's respondents rated Israel's security situation \"good\" or \"very good\", down from 56 percent in July. Only 30 percent felt the Jewish state's world standing was better than in the past, compared to 56 percent in the previous poll. Israel's relations with Arab states have soured since its right-wing government took office in June. Israeli Prime Minister Benajmain Netanyahu's rejection of the \"land-for-peace\" principle underlying five years of Arab-Israeli peace talks has led to an escalation of tensions between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbours. The survey of 1,003 adults had a margin of error of three percent.\n",

      "FEATURE - FAMINE AFTER FEAST FOR ALBANIAN SCHEME INVESTORS. The collapse of hugely popular pyramid investment schemes, which has sparked some of the worst scenes of violence in ex-communist Albania, has plunged the country into its most serious crisis for years. The schemes started to appear in the early 1990s following the fall of communism, and Europe's poorest people soon embarked on a frenzied investment drive when word got out that big money was to be made...and quickly. Undeterred by the failure of similar schemes in Russia, Romania and Bulgaria, many Albanians sold their houses, sheep, cattle and other possessions to join the pyramid bandwagon. But for most, the good times are over. At least five of the top 10 national schemes have either declared bankruptcy or had their bank assets seized by the government. The others are still paying out interest but are not allowing investors to withdraw their capital. First signs of trouble surfaced last October when Albanian Finance Minister Ridvan Bode voiced concern over the schemes at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Economists estimate more than $1.0 billion might have been sunk into the funds and believe most Albanians are affected in some way. Albania was ruled for 45 years until 1990 by one of Europe's harshest communist regimes which banned private bank accounts and private property. Unused to the ways of the free market, many Albanians felt their cash was safe. There was no small print warning them they could lose money as well as make it. First protests erupted two weeks ago when a scheme run by Maksude Kadema, a 32-year old former shoe factory worker known as Sude, collapsed owing her 100,000 creditors $100 million. Sude, who was once heard mistaking the IMF for an FM radio station, raised interest to 16 percent and offered 170 percent over five months. Around 2,000 people a day crammed into her offices from dawn til dusk. In November she stopped paying out. Two other firms, Xhaferri and Populli, registered as charitable foundations, offered 100 percent a month for three months, promising initial investment would yield the same profits in four additional instalments over two years. The schemes have also influenced the value of the Albanian lek currency. In November, the Albanian lek gained strongly on the dollar and German mark because Xhaferri accepted only leks from its numerous depositors. But the lek then weakened in January when Xhaferri investors rushed to turn profits into hard currency. About $800,000 was deposited in the Savings Bank of Albania in one day. Authorities have frozen some $300 million placed in state banks by the two scheme operators and Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi pledged to pay Albanians all the money they have put in failed schemes with bank interest starting from February 5. Xhaferri is a native of the poor farming area of Lushnje where his scheme was most popular and where the most violent protests erupted last weekend. The Gjallica company, which says it owns funds estimated at $20 million has also failed to pay investors since December. Investors in the southwestern port of Vlore where Gjallica is based torched the town hall there last week. Other investment operations are still running but are only paying out interest. Vefa Holding, one of the country's biggest concerns, who says it owns over 240 businesses, has frozen capital invested for between three to six months.\n",

      "Cuba steps up charge U.S. used biological warfare. Cuba said on Tuesday it had asked for a special meeting of signatories of a ban on biological weapons to investigate its claim that the United States dumped a crop pest on the island last year. \"With this action, Cuba makes clear its desire for light to be shed on this new and unjustified biological attack on it, through the international mechanisms of the U.N. system established for this purpose,\" the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma said in a statement. \"Caught red-handed this time, the United States will have to reply to international public opinion,\" it added. Granma said the Cuban government on Monday handed the request to Russia, in Moscow's capacity as depositary of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention banning deployment and use of biological weapons. President Fidel Castro's government, which has accused the United States in the past of biological warfare, first denounced the latest alleged attack in May. It reiterated the charge at a special U.N. General Assembly meeting on the environment last month. Havana has said a U.S. government crop duster used in anti-narcotics operations sprayed a substance over western Cuba last October that led to the appearance on the island two months later of Thrips Palmi, a bug that damages many crops. Washington has denied the accusations. The State Department has acknowledged an S2R crop-duster plane flew over western Cuba during a flight from Florida to the Cayman Islands last October, but said it emitted only smoke to identify its position to a passing Cuban commercial airliner. Cuba has said this is false since smoke emissions are not used in standard aviation practice. Havana adds the crop-duster concerned is not normally equipped with a smoke generator. The crew of the Cuban plane that flew nearby have said they saw a liquid, not smoke, being emitted from the crop-duster. Granma said Cuba was using a 1991 provision of the 1972 convention by which a country that has been a victim of a biological attack may request a consultative meeting of parties to the convention to investigate the attack. It said this was the first time the provision had been used by a country that had been attacked. Granma said Cuba presented Russia with a \"meticulously\" argued set of documents backing its case. The newspaper added that according to the biological weapons treaty, Russia now had 30 days to call a preliminary meeting to arrange the Official Consultative Meeting, which should take place within 60 days of it being requested. The charge of biological warfare is the latest spat in long hostile relations between Havana and Washington, which have no diplomatic ties. The United States maintains a 35-year-old economic embargo on Cuba and is the most aggressive advocate of political change in the hemisphere's only communist nation. Havana views Washington as bent on stripping Cuba of its independence.\n",

      "G7 leaders say Congo aid depends on reforms. The world's leading industrial democracies told the new Democratic Republic of the Congo on Saturday that its eligibility for aid would depend on its commitment to democratic reform and respect for human rights. A report by foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations and Russia said it was important to assist the new authorities who took over the vast African country last month and looked forward to close cooperation with other potential donors. It said the changes in the country, formerly named Zaire, highlighted the \"importance of peaceful democratic transition and the establishment of a broadly-based interim administration.\" The report said: \"We believe it is important to assist the new authorities in the transition to an elected government, promote respect for human rights, address urgent humanitarian needs and facilitate economic renewal.\" But it added: \"The willingness of our governments to assist in the rebuilding of national institutions will depend on the new authorities' demonstrating their commitment to democratic reform, including elections, sound economic policies, public accountability and respect for human rights, including protection of refugees.\" U.N. investigators arrived in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, on Friday to probe alleged massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees by new President Laurent Kabila's forces or their regional allies. The mission follows persistent allegations of massacres deep in the jungles of what was then Zaire by Kabila's rebel forces. His fighters and their Tutsi allies from Rwanda and Burundi toppled dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in mid-May.\n",

      "Top Swiss banker tries to open vaults of secrecy. To find out just how tense the Swiss are amid the furore over lost Jewish bank accounts, ask the head of Switzerland's Bankers Association about his mail. \"I get hate letters. People tell me, 'You are a rotten man, you are a shame for this country,\" said Georg Krayer, an outspoken critic of how the banks have handled the crisis. \"The day I leave this job will be a happy day.\" Such are the times in Switzerland. Krayer is a leading figure in government efforts to restore Switzerland's international reputation, damaged badly by unanswered questions over Jewish claims that its banks hoarded unclaimed deposits of Jews and cleared looted Nazi gold. As the Alpine nation tries to come to terms with its wartime role and its close commercial ties with Nazi Germany, Swiss banking secrecy and ethics are also coming into sharp focus. Secrecy is the backbone of Switzerland's powerful banking industry which manages some $1.8 trillion in private assets. But secrecy also guarded the ill-gotton gains of fallen rulers like Philippine's late Ferdinand Marcos and Haiti's Jean- Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, and, officials suspect, drug money sent to the jailed brother of Mexica's ex-leader Carlos Salinas. \"When I was 16, I used to watch French movies with gangsters in them. The gangsters always had a bank account in Geneva or Zurich. This was as normal as smoking Gauloises,\" Krayer said. \"We have to deal with the myths of the past, the whole code of conduct,\" he told Reuters. \"Where's the money from? Where's the client from? Banks shouldn't have secrets.\" Krayer's brave attempts at openness sit strangely in the opaque world of Swiss banking. Fellow bankers, at a meeting with journalists this week, were painfully reluctant to answer questions on the controversy, Switzerland's worst foreign policy crisis since World War Two. Asked if Geneva's reputation as a world centre for private banking could suffer from the crisis, Michael Derobert, secretary-general of the Swiss Private Bankers Association, said: \"No, no. The answer is no. Absolutely not.\" The bankers sighed and looked away as Krayer raised question after question over the wartime role of Swiss bankers. \"I blame all of us,\" Krayer said. \"You can't say we're number one in private banking, we're number one in asset management, we're number one here and there but when it comes to these (Jewish) problems, we'd like to lower them to number 10 down the list. These problems are related.\" \"For the moment, we don't feel the damage done on a private client level, but the big 'but' is that a lot of international clients are looking very closely at what we're doing.\" Krayer said a majority of Swiss banks paid little attention to the crisis mainly because they had little U.S. exposure. What is at stake is the international reputation of the top three Swiss banks, United Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp and Credit Suisse which have a big U.S. client base, he said. On Thursday, two Chicago aldermen proposed an ordinance requiring banks handling city funds to divest holdings in Swiss businesses until Holocaust victims' claims have been addressed. New York state has threatened a similar boycott. Records uncovered in Lausanne's cantonal archives that show banks closed thousands of dormant savings accounts after World War Two without owners' knowledge have stoked the controversy. They list the names of thousands of account holders, mainly Swiss but including many foreigners, and may open the way to fresh claims against banks which had repeatedly said they missed many, if not all, of their archives about old accounts. \"These savings books are a controversial question,\" Swiss Bankers Association board member Jean-Paul Chapuis told Reuters. Krayer said the ultimate questions raised by the dormant Jewish accounts were not about money but about morality: \"We're not that lily-white clean. We have to clean up our house.\"\n",

      "Taleban say criticism of policy on women misplaced. A leader of the militant Islamic Taleban movement on Tuesday dismissed criticism from the United Nations and Western countries of its policies towards women. \"Afghan society is different from Western society,\" said Maulvi Wakil Ahmed, a senior member of the Taleban shura (council) contacted in the southern city of Kandahar. \"In Afghan society it is impossible for women to live as they do in Western society,\" he said. \"We are working on women's rights in the light of Afghan society and Islam.\" He said there had been a \"misunderstanding\" between the Taleban administration in Kabul and the United Nations, the United States and other countries. This was partly due to what he called incorrect reporting by the media, \"who see everything in Kabul through Western eyes.\" U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has warned the Taleban that discrimination against women in employment and education could seriously affect relief programmes. He also told U.N. agencies to adhere to the U.N. Charter on equal rights for women and speak with one voice in Afghanistan. \"We have decided to restate our single, system-wide policy on the question of gender equality,\" he said in a statement sent on Monday to U.N. agencies operating in Afghanistan. The United States also warned the new Islamist rulers in Kabul that they risked forfeiting reconstruction aid for Afghanistan if they continued to restrict women's rights. The U.S. State Department said it had seen \"some very disturbing signs\" since the Taleban captured Kabul two weeks ago and clamped down on women working and girls going to school. Taleban directives \"threaten to generate international isolation which would deny Afghanistan the international assistance it so badly needs after so many years of war.\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns also said the curbs on women were likely to \"severely limit their ability to mobilise the population to dig out from over a decade of war, to rebuild the country, to establish a sense of national unity.\" The restrictions on women have been heavily reported in major newspapers in the United States, where women's rights groups are influential in domestic politics. The Taleban have told women employees, with the exception of health workers, to stay at home until the administration decides how they can return to work without being in contact with men. Taleban leaders say they will not deny education to girls and women, but say security conditions do not permit them to return to schools and universities immediately. They say the educational system must also be reorganised along Islamic lines. Afghan women and foreign aid workers have voiced scepticism about Taleban promises on female education and employment, citing experience in other Taleban-held cities where curbs have stayed in force even though there are no security problems.\n",

      "Human rights group hits out at U.N. refugee agency. The human rights group Amnesty International has hit out at the U.N. refugee agency, saying it was condoning the imminent expulsion of half a million Rwandan refugees by Tanzania in contravention of its basic principles. Amnesty in a statement on Friday said it was concerned at the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Tanzania's government on Thursday telling the refugees to go home by the end of this month. It noted their joint statement made no mention of options for those who feared human rights violations if they returned to Rwanda while it was the responsibility of UNHCR and Tanzania as asylum government to ensure that people at risk were protected. \"By issuing this joint statement, UNHCR is effectively rubber-stamping this decision by Tanzania which contravenes its own basic principles of protection of refugees,\" Amnesty said. \"Instead it should be publicly protesting at Tanzania's decision.\" \"UNHCR officials have stated that this will not be a forced return, yet the refugees appear not to have been allowed to decide individually whether they can return. A return in these circumstances would effectively amount to forced repatriation. \"Amnesty International appeals for an immediate withdrawal of the decision by the Tanzanian government to expel all Rwandese refugees by 31 December, 1996, and is urging UNHCR to desist from taking actions which would condone this decision.\" UNHCR and Tanzania's government have said they believe it is safe for the 542,000 refugees in Tanzania to go home after the return of an estimated 500,000 refugees from Zaire last month. UNHCR officials say any refugees who refuse to return from Tanzania probably fear reprisals for their role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide and therefore may ultimately lose their refugee status. UNHCR officials say they have been assured by the Tanzanian government that force will not be used against \"ordinary refugees\". But the joint statement failed to make any mention of repatriation being voluntary, as required by UNHCR's mandate. \"The refugees are not just an anonymous mass of half a million people who can be treated in an identical fashion,\" Amnesty said. \"There may be many among them who would be at risk on return.\" \"Over half a million people are being expected to return at less than one month's notice, with apparently no provision for those who continue to fear human rights violations in Rwanda to exercise their right to seek asylum,\" it added. It noted the joint UNHCR-Tanzanian statement made no mention of continuing human rights abuses in Rwanda or the detention of some 87,000 prisoners, accused of involvement in the genocide. \"Amnesty International is concerned that the international community has been playing down the real level of human rights violations in Rwanda in order to entice the refugees to return,\" it said. Amnesty said to date there were no large-scale arrests of killings of returnees among the 500,000 refugees who returned from Zaire last month after being forced out of their camps by fighting. \"However in view of the persistent pattern of human rights violations in Rwanda it is still much too early to judge their longer-term safety in the country,\" the Amnesty statement said. Rwanda's government says it will take legal action against returnees involved in the genocide but only after they have returned to home communes and investigations have been opened.\n",

      "Taiwan envoy in new mystery mission overseas. Taiwan's foreign minister dropped from sight on Tuesday to embark on what local media said was yet another overseas mission cloaked in secrecy to evade rival China's tightening diplomatic embargo. The Foreign Ministry, adopting the tight-lipped policy seen during previous secret sojourns by Taiwan leaders, said minister John Chang had left the country for \"official business\" but would not comment on a report he may have gone to west Asia. \"Minister Chang left for official business. He'll be back in a few days,\" Vice-Minister Cheng Chien-jen told reporters. \"Because of other considerations, we can't provide other details before (his return).\" It would be inconvenient to name Chang's hosts, he said. State television said Chang's plane was bound for Rome but that he stopped in Abu Dhabi, a member of the United Arab Emirates. It was not clear if Abu Dhabi was Chang's destination or a waystation, as a visit to neighbouring Jordan also was possible, the television said. President Lee Teng-hui visited the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in 1995. The Liberty Times, quoting unidentified sources, said Chang left Taiwan late on Monday for a three-to-four-day visit to some foreign nations that have no diplomatic ties with the island but which nonetheless maintain \"secret and close\" links. He was bound for west Asia and perhaps Europe, it said. Other media said the possible stops on Chang's mysterious tour included Israel, Russia and Ukraine. Chang and Vice-President Lien Chan have followed a similar pattern for numerous overseas trips in the past year, simply dropping from sight for days at a time as international and Taiwan media scurried to track them down. Lien managed such a secret visit to Ukraine in August, triggering a minor row between Kiev and a furious Beijing. Similarly, Chang dropped from sight after his December visit to South Africa, where had sought in vain to reverse Pretoria's November 27 decision to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei by the end of 1997. Chang surfaced in Belgium on December 7 but failed to win access to Belgian leaders or other European or African officials there as Beijing diplomats mounted what Taiwanese officials and media said was a concerted drive to prevent such encounters. Communist China, Taiwan's arch rival since a civil war split them in 1949, regards the island as a rebel province ineligible for sovereign ties. It has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule. Chang nonetheless said on Monday he would visit diplomatic ally Guatemala for the December 29 signing of a peace pact between its government and leftist rebels. The trip is one of four damage-control missions planned by top Taiwan officials since South Africa, Taipei's largest ally, declared it was switching ties. Beijing refuses to recognise any country that recognises Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government, but has stepped up efforts to win over the 30 states that still do.\n",

      "Sierra Leone thieves steal investiture regalia. Gunmen have broken into the offices of Sierra Leone's chief justice and stolen the regalia used for swearing in new heads of state. The regalia could be wanted soon if Major Johnny Paul Koroma, who seized power in a coup last month, is to take an oath of office as president. But it was not clear on Monday whether the thieves were opponents aiming to prevent Koroma's investiture or supporters hoping to hold a ceremony without Chief Justice Samuel Beccles Davies. Senior police sources said the thieves struck on Sunday night, making off with the Bible and Koran used in state ceremonies, and the gowns and wigs of the chief justice, the supreme court and the appeal court. They also took documents which could relate to the treason charge still outstanding against Koroma, who was freed in a jailbreak at the start of the May 25 coup. \"The armed men ransacked the files in the office of the chief justice and the other judges and took away files containing evidence of many prisoners who had been standing trial and serving jail sentences,\" said a police source. The chief justice's car and vehicles impounded by the courts were also taken. Koroma and seven other soldiers had been standing trial before the coup for treason over an alleged coup attempt last September against the civilian government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. Senior Justice Ministry sources said the new military junta had been taking steps over the past few days to have the case dismissed. Koroma has declared himself head of state but has yet to take the oath of office which must be administered by the chief justice. \"It is unlikely that the chief justice will swear in Koroma as head of state without his regalia,\" one justice ministry source said.\n",

      "Rwandan human tide trudges home from Tanzania. More than 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees ended two-and-a-half years of exile on Monday, streaming on foot from Tanzanian to Rwanda in the biggest human tide since Tanzanian troops and police pushed them to go home. More than 200 children were by Monday separated from their parents in the crush of refugees and a U.N. official said he feared the total could reach 1,000 by the end of the day. In the lines snaking towards Rwanda, mothers tied themselves to their children with yellow string supplied by the Red Cross. In Geneva, U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) spokeswoman Pam O'Tool said 103,000 refugees crossed into Rwanda on Monday, bringing to 133,000 the number of returnees in the past three days. She said some 100,000 Hutus in Tanzania were headed for Rwanda and another 50,000 were preparing to leave camps in Kitale area. \"This means we have more than 280,000 people who have either returned or on the way home,\" she told Reuters. There had been a total of 540,000 Rwandan refugees in Tanzania but O'Tool said she had no information on the whereabouts of the rest. Tanzania on December 5 ordered all Rwandan Hutu refugees out by the end of the month and troops intervened when many surged out of their camps and headed away from the Rwandan border. Many refugees were expected to sleep overnight on the road from the camps in Tanzania, as they have done since they started crossing in large numbers on Saturday, but the border crossing at Rusomo bridge was due to remain open for those still walking. Another UNHCR spokeswoman said troops on Monday moved into Karagwe camp, the northernmost of Tanzania's 11 Rwandan camps, and refugees from there would arrive at the border by the end of the week. Trucks, buses and vans were ready inside Rwanda to pick up footsore refugees, whose will to stay out of Rwanda cracked with a brief flurry of blows from stick-wielding Tanzanian troops. The refugees left Rwanda in 1994 during the genocide by Hutu mobs and militiamen of about 800,000 Tutsis. Many say they fear reprisals from Tutsis for the slaughter if they return home. A column of refugees estimated by UNHCR at 200,000 on Monday stretched for 90 km (55 miles) inside Tanzania. Anne Willem Bijleveld of UNHCR said soldiers used force to break the grip of intimidators opposed to the mass return. \"In order to break the grip of the leaders...some sort of force must be used,\" he said. \"We've never been able to deal with the grip of intimidators. This was the main problem from day one.\" Asked why UNHCR would not protest to Tanzania, he said: \"We feel the situation in Rwanda is conducive to return and that the people so far have been totally misled by their leaders.\" \"What we witnessed is the military and police trying to do it (repatriation) in a most peaceful manner,\" Bijleveld added. UNCHR has been criticised by the human rights group Amnesty International for its stance over the Rwandan refugees in Tanzania, which Amnesty says is at odds with the U.N. agency's commitment to protect refugees from forced expulsion. Rwandan and Tanzanian authorities barred journalists from the border area for much of the time but most refugees seemed resigned to returning under pressure from troops and police. Human rights groups have reported no mass killings in Rwanda since an estimated 560,000 refugees flooded back from eastern Zaire last month after fighting forced them out of their camps.\n",

      "Nobel laureate says East Timor's ordeal must end. Jose Ramos-Horta, the East Timorese resistance campaigner named joint winner of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, said he hoped the award would send a signal to Indonesia that his people's suffering must end. Celebrating the award at his mother's home in the suburbs of Sydney, the 46-year-old resistance spokesman said the prize should not have gone to him, but to jailed resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. \"I would feel much happier if instead of my name, his was selected,\" Ramos-Horta told Reuters. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 after the abrupt departure of its Portuguese colonisers. It annexed the territory the following year in a move never recognised by the United Nations and strongly disputed by Portugal. Ramos-Horta, who left East Timor three days before the Indonesian invasion, shared the 1996 Peace Prize with Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's outspoken Roman Catholic bishop. \"I'm happy but surprised, because Bishop Belo deserves the Nobel Peace Prize but the other person who should be sharing the award with him is my leader, Xanana Gusmao,\" he said of the East Timorese resistance chief captured by Indonesian troops in 1992 and serving a prison sentence in Jakarta. \"He's an outstanding man of peace and democracy, a man of courage...I have done my best, but there is nothing exceptional about it when your country is occupied.\" The announcement itself appeared to have come as a total surprise to Ramos-Horta and other East Timorese refugees in Sydney, who celebrated with cheap Australian champagne in his mother's flat above a suburban Sydney betting shop. Ramos-Horta said he was playing with his two-year-old niece Sarah early on Friday evening when a Portuguese journalist phoned and told him he had won. There had been no call from the Nobel Committee in Oslo. \"I am humble. Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, Desmond Tutu -- who am I?\" he asked, listing the names of other Nobel prize-winners. Ramos-Horta said he hoped the prize would show Indonesia \"that the people of East Timor have suffered long enough and that there must be serious dialogue under United Nations auspices to resolve the problem\". The United Nations has brokered regular meetings between the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal and has also started an intra-Timorese dialogue. But progress has been painfully slow, with the substantive issue of East Timor's future political status barely addressed. The next meeting is due in New York on December 21. Ramos-Horta founded and lectures at a school of diplomacy at the law faculty of Sydney's University of New South Wales. But the U.S.-educated lawyer spends around nine months of the year travelling around the world, promoting the cause of the East Timorese people, and has a small appartment in Lisbon. \"I was already very confident that the next two or three years are going to be a turning point in our struggle because things are changing in Indonesia,\" Ramos-Horta said. \"There is also a changed perception in the world, in the United States, in the European Union, towards the regime in Indonesia. So even before that, my gut feeling and my assesment of the situation is that there is going to be changes for Indonesia..\" he added.\n",

      "Plavsic blocked over parliament's dissolution. Dan De Luce President Biljana Plavsic on Thursday defied hardliners trying to force her from power and ordered the dissolution of the Bosnian Serb parliament \"to protect the state from total disaster\". The government which is to loyal former president and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic said it would block her \"inexplicable and unconstitutional\" decision. The hardliners, who control the police, were expected to go ahead with a parliament session on Friday to try to remove her from office. Army chief General Pero Colic pledged the military would not intervene in the Bosnia Serb republic's worst political crisis since the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war but international support sided increasingly with Plavsic. U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard appealed for restraint from both camps and warned Karadzic and his allies that if they sought \"confrontation, they will get it ... they must, must change their behaviour\". Western mediators, who have found Plavsic pragmatic to deal with despite her hardline wartime record, are fearful the peace process will be jeopardised if the hardliners topple her. The feud has renewed antagonism between hardliners, based in the nationalist stronghold in Pale outside Sarajevo, and Plavsic's supporters in the northern town of Banja Luka who believe Western peacemaking cannot be defied indefinitely. Karadzic accused Plavsic of treachery and of plotting his arrest by NATO and that of former army commander General Ratko Mladic who is also charge with war crimes. The report, broadcast by Bosnian Serb television from Pale, was denied by NATO peacekeepers but fuelled the political tension as both sides vied for public support. Plavsic said the intention was to discredit her with the population who get most of their news from the television which is controlled by hardliners. The dissolution document said the police led by Interior Minister Dragan Kijac organised crime and smuggled with the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia. It condemned Prime Minister Goran Klickovic's refusal to work with Plavsic. Both men are proteges of Karadzic who has continued to wield power despite having been driven from public office last year under the Bosnian peace agreement. Plavsic said the conflict \"threatens the very survival of the Bosnian Serb republic.\" She set a date for general elections on September 1 and set about trying to form a national government. Gelbard, who had talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic earlier in the day, was met Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb member of Bosnia's multi-ethnic presidency in Pale. Krajisnik and Karadzic have been the two single most powerful figures in the Bosnian Serb fight against Bosnian independence and were denounced by Plavsic for using their influence to enrich themselves through their control of the economy. Gelbard is in the region to represent the five-nation contact group which has underwritten the Bosnian peace agreement and which tacitly sided with Plavsic on Wednesday. He did not side explicitly with Plavsic, who was democratically elected last year, but said: \"The United States supports the full implementation of the Dayton (peace) agreements and we will suport those who will carry out the Dayton agreements.\" He said the activites of Karadzic, Krajisnik and Bosnian Serb police chief Dragan Kijac \"have been extremely dangerous.\" Kijac's police had set up illegal roadblacks and threatened U.S. troops serving with the NATO special force (SFOR) in Bosnia. British soldiers in the NATO-led peace force patrolled the streets of Banja Luka overnight to prevent violence from erupting between Plavsic's supporters and Karadzic's police.\n",

      "Mobutu to return soon to Zaire - prime minister. Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, convalescing in France, will soon return home to oversee the refugee aid mission in eastern Zaire, Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Saturday. \"He will soon return to Zaire to follow the operations which are unrolling in the field,\" Kengo told reporters after talks with Mobutu, who is recuperating at his Riviera villa after prostate cancer surgery in Switzerland. Kengo, who flew to southern France from Brussels earlier on Saturday to meet Mobutu, said he expected the Zairean head of state to meet his doctor \"during the second half of the month\" before returning home to Kinshasa. In the meantime, he said he and Mobutu would continue to work together on the shaping of the humanitarian mission on Zairean soil following its approval by the U.N. Security Council. Under the U.N. plan, a multinational force under Canadian leadership will be dispatched to eastern Zaire in the next few days to help refugees stranded by fighting between Zairean forces and Tutsi rebels. Kengo said Zaire did not want nations to take advantage of their participation in the multinational force by \"continuing their aggression inside Zaire under cover of the United Nations\". He did not name any nations he feared might do so and offered no further explanation of the remark. Zaire accuses Rwanda of backing the Tutsi rebels who are fighting its forces. Kengo said Zaire also opposed the establishment of any new refugee camps on Zairean soil. \"If there are to be any new transit camps, they must be constructed in Rwanda,\" he told reporters. Mobutu has been keeping a low profile in France since his arrival at his palatial Riviera villa on November 4 after treatment for prostate cancer in Switzerland. Aides have previously said he planned to return soon to Zaire, but he has appeared weak and thin during his few public appearances. Mobutu has however, held talks during his convalescence with United Nations envoy Raymond Chretien, Congo President Pascal Lissouba and South African Vice President Thabo Mbeki.\n",

      "Burundi nearly free of Rwandan Hutu refugees. Aid officials said they expected the last Rwandan refugees in Burundi who want to go home voluntarily to do so on Tuesday, ending the biggest repatriation since two million fled two years ago. The officials said they had sent more than 100 trucks to move some 6,000 Rwandans from Rukuramigabo camp in Burundi to a transit centre near the southwestern Rwandan town of Butare. \"We have sent down a trucking capacity for over 7,000 people. It's more than 100 trucks,\" said Simona Opitz, a spokeswoman for International Organisation for Migration (IOM). \"We hope to get everyone out from Rukuramigabo today. Most returnees will pass through Musange transit camp before returning to their home communes,\" she added in the Rwandan capital. Officials of the U.N. refugee agency said they would find out on Tuesday whether any of the last 6,000 refugees at the last Rwandan camp in Burundi refused to go home voluntarily. The biggest Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi was emptied on Thursday except for 223 Hutus who said they did not want to go back to their homeland and were allowed by Burundian authorities to stay. They say they fear arrest or attack if they return home. There were more than 130,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi at the start of the year. The Hutu refugees leaving Burundi are part of more than two million who fled Rwanda in 1994 during civil war and in fear of reprisal attacks for the genocidal killing of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs. Refugees began returning in large numbers after Pierre Buyoya and Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army seized power on July 25. They have accused troops of harassing them and three were killed by Burundian soldiers on August 18. Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said last week Zaire and Rwanda had agreed an \"organised, massive and unconditional\" repatriation of 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire. He said the repatriation would be \"enormous and immediate\" and Zaire would close all Rwandan refugee camps on its soil. UNHCR was not consulted in advance about the Zairean-Rwandan agreement, which prompted a Rwandan Hutu refugee lobby group to warn expulsions of refugees from Zaire could start within days. The international community has spent millions of dollars in aid on refugees in Burundi amid constant fears of their being dragged into conflict between Burundian Hutu rebels and the army. The U.N. World Food Programme said on Monday four trucks carrying high protein biscuits, medicine and rice for displaced and refugees in Burundi arrived on Sunday after regional states exempted them from nearly month-old sanctions on the country. Rwandan authorities screen returning refugees and arrest any suspected of involvement in genocide. There are nearly 80,000 prisoners and detainees held in prisons and lockups in Rwanda.\n",

      "Australia warns Cambodia on aid. Australia on Friday formally summoned the Cambodian ambassador to protest against a power grab by Cambodian strongman Hun Sen and warn that his move threatened future aid. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told reporters his officials had warned Ambassador Vun Chheang that Australia believed constitutional rule should be restored, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh returned to power, and democratic elections held on schedule next year. \"It is very important that Hun Sen ensures that the Cambodian constitution is upheld, the Paris peace accords are implemented, that elections take place in May of next year ... and that they're open and free and fair elections,\" Downer said. \"We're making a very clear point now.\" Downer said Australia's A$32 million (US$24 million) annual aid and military assistance was being reviewed and Canberra was contacting other aid donors to organise a coordinated response to the upheaval in Cambodia. \"We do think it's appropriate that the major aid donors coordinate their response to the events in Cambodia,\" he said. Downer, speaking as Australia began an airlift of hundred of its nationals from Phnom Penh, said Canberra had to consider humanitarian issues in deciding the fate of its aid to the poor Southeast Asian nation. \"We also want to deliver a message to Hun Sen and his colleagues, the CPP (Cambodian People's Party), that we as aid donors make an enormous contribution to Cambodia and we expect Cambodia, and in particular the CPP and Hun Sen, to act in a manner which is consistent with not only the Paris peace process but also the Cambodia constitution,\" he said. Cambodia's major donors pledged US$450 million in aid to Phnom Penh during their annual meeting in Paris last week. Australian air force planes began arriving in Cambodia on Friday to evacuate hundreds of Australians and other foreigners seeking to flee conflict between forces loyal to Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Cambodia was thrown into turmoil at the weekend when Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a military takeover and grabbed control of the capital, ousting his rival Ranariddh. (A$1 = US$0.74)\n",

      "Mobutu's son says Zaire committed to elections. Nzanga Mobutu, son of Zaire's ailing president, said the country would miss its July 9 target date for holding elections but that the Mobutu camp remained committed to continuing Zaire's transition to democracy, \"The phenomenon of (rebel leader Laurent) Kabila (has) interupted the electoral process,\" president Mobutu Sese Seko's son told Belgian newspaper Le Soir in an interview published on Tuesday. \"The date of July 9 which had been retained for these elections cannot be maintained. Things must be reorganised, and that will take some time,\" he added. July elections have looked increasingly uncertain since the rebels took up arms in eastern Zaire last October. The rebel alliance now controls half of the vast central African nation. On Sunday President Mobutu defiantly dismissed a rebel deadline for him to quit and said he had no plans to go into exile. But the president, who is suffering from cancer, did leave the door open for face to face talks with Kabila. \"There is no question of exile. The president has made no request in this vein,\" reiterated Nzanga Mobutu, who Le Soir said was in charge of presidential communications in Zaire. Once Kabila had officially and \"politely\" requested a meeting with the president a time and place would be fixed and an agenda discussed, he said. \"Eventually the formation of another government could be discussed. But we stick absolutely to the continuation of the electoral process, for the conditions required for these elections have been brought together,\" he added. Meanwhile, the army had received clear instructions to defend the capital Kinshasa, he said. \"Obviously we hope there will not be a blood-bath and it is in order to avoid one that numerous foreign countries insist that we reach a negotiated solution,\" Nzanga Mobutu said. The United States said on Monday it would be a \"crime and a terrible tragedy\" if Zaire's civil war reached Kinshasa, adding that it was urging Kabila's rebels and Mobutu to resume negotiations in South Africa. On Tuesday in Kinshasa many shops and business remained closed for a second day as Mobutu's opponents stepped up pressure to end his 32-year rule. Paramilitary security forces blocked off main roads leading to campuses where students were due to begin a protest march.\n",

Morrow said the box, which had a message reading \"Merry Election Day\" and a photograph showing a scene of destruction, was found outside Republican Party offices in Tyler.

      "Utah chemical arms destruction to begin Thursday. The U.S. Defence Department said it would begin destroying chemical weapons on Thursday at its Toole facility in Utah as its first domestic step toward destroying the entire U.S. chemical arsenal by the year 2004. It said last week the first weapons to be destroyed at Toole would be M-55 rockets filled with nerve gas. \"This will start the large-scale destruction of chemical weapons,\" Pentagon spokesman Capt. Mike Doubleday said at a regular defence briefing. He said an installation on the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific has been destroying the weapons since 1993 but at a low rate. Toole was to be the first of eight locations in the United States that would destroy them. The United States pledged not to use chemical weapons and must by law destroy its entire arsenal of 3.6 million chemical weapons by 2004. Toole was holding more than 44 percent of the U.S. stockpile of 30,000 tons of chemical weaponry. \"We are eliminating an entire class of weapons and we are doing it in a very safe and secure way,\" Doubleday said. Another defence official said the United States no longer needed chemical weapons to deter potential enemies from using them because it has other weapons to overpower a chemical enemy. He said many of the U.S. chemical weapons were obsolete -- for example, the M-55 rockets to be destroyed first no longer have launchers. The U.S. Defence Department said U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell denied in Salt Lake City on Wednesday a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by private groups led by the Kentucky-based Chemical Weapons Working Group. It said the judge ruled the groups did not show that the incineration of the weapons would put people around the Toole Chemical Agent Disposal Facility at risk. It said she wrote that \"for individuals living closest to TOCDF, the risks resulting from continued storage are 100 times greater than the risks resulting from disposal operations.\"\n",

      "Italian police enter League headquarters in Milan. Police seeking evidence of alleged anti-constitutional activities forced their way into the headquarters of Italy's separatist Northern League on Wednesday after scuffles with senior party members, reporters said. They said detectives entered the reception area of the building in Milan and then forced aside three League members of parliament, including former interior minister Roberto Maroni, who had tried to block their access to offices. Reporters at the scene said Maroni was later taken to hospital on a stretcher. A League spokesman told Reuters that Maroni, league leader Umberto Bossi and senator Francesco Speroni were involved in the scuffle with police. \"Fists were flying and Maroni was hit in the head, falling and hurting himself,\" he said. Bossi, who arrived shortly after police entered the building, called the search \"an act of pure fascism\". \"The regime has lost its head,\" said Bossi, who declared a separate \"republic\" in northern Italy last weekend. Reporters said Maroni and other League officials shouted repeatedly: \"These things happened with Pinochet,\" referring to the former Chilean right-wing dictator. League parliamentarian Mario Borghezio meanwhile declared himself to be a \"political prisoner\". The police had spent several hours outside the building, where Maroni and other senior League officials had contested the validity of a search warrant. It was among several issued by a prosecutor in the northern town of Verona who is investigating alleged criminal attempts to undermine the unity of the state by three organisers of the League's self-styled \"green shirt\" security squad. League offices elsewhere and homes of members were also searched on Wednesday. Calls for criminal action against the League have grown since Bossi proclaimed a northern \"republic of Padania\" in Venice on Sunday. \"If they wanted to intimidate us they have had the opposite effect,\" Bossi said. \"The citizens of Padania will carry the green handkerchief into the cities of Padania, where they will dance and celebrate,\" he added. The Italian news agency AGI reported that police at League headquarters had given Maroni and the other two parliamentarians three warnings to stand aside before pushing past them.\n",

      "Peaceful end for last big seasonal N.Ireland march. The last major parade of Northern Ireland's turbulent Protestant marching season went off peacefully on Saturday after police banned passage on part of the route to help defuse Roman Catholic anger. An estimated 12,000 members of the Apprentice Boys, a Protestant group, marched through mainly Catholic Londonderry to commemorate a 17th century siege of the city by troops loyal to King James the Second, a Catholic. Masked men, one armed with a handgun, hijacked a van from a Catholic estate and abandoned it on the Craigavon bridge over which the Apprentice Boys marched behind bands to celebrate their Protestant faith and British loyalty. British army experts carried out a controlled explosion on the vehicle. No bomb was found. A handful of drunk teenagers threw stones and heckled 300 of the Apprentice Boy marchers who earlier paraded along the 300-year-old city walls to the sound of a single drumbreat from a military-style band, witnesses said. Pipe bands stayed silent out of respect for Catholics. On previous occasions hundreds of Catholics had harried the parade but barely 20, marshalled by local residents, turned out. The walls overlook the Catholic Bogside area where residents had threatened huge counter-demonstrations unless the Apprentice Boys rerouted so-called feeder parades. Police banned the feeder parades and the Bogside Residents Association called off its threat, avoiding any re-run of the sectarian clashes which paralysed Northern Ireland during last year's marching season and one parade earlier this year. The Apprentice Boys turned the start of this year's march into a pageant with hundreds of volunteers dressed in 17th century clothes re-enacting the 105-day siege of 1689 which was relieved by troops loyal to King William of Orange, a Protestant. The organisation is named after 13 apprentices or trainees who slammed shut the gates of the city against invading troops. King William gives his name to Northern Ireland's main Protestant marching organisation, the Orange Order, and he went on to defeat King James on the battlefield to entrench Protestants in Ireland and on the British throne. Londonderry Mayor Martin Bradley told reporters: \"It (the pageant) is a very important step for this city. This is not about flag-waving but a celebration of history and culture.\" \"I hope it goes from strength to strength and becomes a tourist attraction,\" he said. Donncha Macnaillais, spokesmen for the Bogside Residents, attended the pageant and personally silenced a small crowd of teenage drunks, witnesses said. \"It is a bit symbolic, possibly the way forward for all of us,\" he said of the pageant. The Orange Order cancelled three disputed parades this year to avoid inflaming sectarian tension after the first major march at Drumcree, near Portadown, exploded into violence. The same march in 1996 was banned, provoking days of Protestant riots, then allowed in a move which ignited Catholic wrath and some fo the worst street violence in decades. This year was the first time the Orange Order had cancelled key marches and was followed on July 20 by a ceasefire from the Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas to their 28-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland. \"I think it is quite likely that problems with parades are coming to an end everywhere,\" Macnaillais, commented. The Catholic-backed IRA and its political wing, Sinn Fein, have long campaigned for marches to be banned or rerouted and describe them as sectarian intimidation.\n",

      "Apartheid hitman says Palme killer in Mozambique. A self-confessed apartheid killer said on Saturday he knew the identity of the man who assassinated Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986. Dirk Coetzee, stoking the growing belief in a South African connection to Palme's unsolved murder, told Swedish television that the killer lived in Mozambique. \"There is no doubt that South Africa was behind the murder of Olof Palme, no doubt at all,\" said Coetzee, who is due to stand trial in December for a murder he has already confessed to carrying out as an apartheid hit squad leader. Coetzee said the man was connected with Craig Williamson, accused in a Pretoria court on Thursday of being behind Palme's murder. The man who made the accusation, Eugene de Kock, was Coetzee's successor as head of the hit squad. Williamson has denied the charges. Coetzee, asked by a Swedish television reporter if his information was based on hearsay, acknowledged he did not have first-hand information about the man he accused of carrying out the assassination. \"Hearsay is exactly what we work with in the secret police,\" he said. Coetzee appealed to Swedish authorities to take the new information on Palme's murder seriously. \"What I am saying now will be confirmed 100 percent. You will come back to me and tell me \"now we know you are speaking the truth'.\" The Swedish news agency TT quoted Coetzee as telling the South African newspaper Beeld on Saturday that 80 or 90 South African agents took part in the planning for Palme's murder. Both De Kock and Coetzee spoke of \"Operation Long Reach\", a plan by apartheid-era hit squads to eliminate high-profile opponents of South Africa's apartheid regime. Palme, a fiery orator well-known for defending Third World minorities, was a vocal enemy of apartheid. Swedish newspapers reported on Saturday that police knew Williamson had been in Sweden at the time of Palme's death but that he had not been anywhere near the central Stockholm street where the prime minister was shot dead late at night while walking home with his wife. A possible South African connection was first mooted in the Swedish press in 1987. But it did not appear to have been taken seriously by detectives investigating the assassination, who rarely mentioned it as a serious possibility. Instead, Swedish police have favoured the theory of a loner with a grudge against the leftwing Palme carrying out a spontaneous killing and disappearing afterwards. Swedish police have been wallowing in controversy since the killing. Several police chiefs have resigned over the number of blunders made during the investigation.\n",

      "Hannay seeks prospect of Cyprus talks in '97. Negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to resolve the stalemate in divided Cyprus could take place in the first half of next year, a senior British diplomat said on Friday. \"I have detected a change in the attitude towards the desirability of having serious negotiations (towards a settlement) in the first half of 1997, yes,\" special envoy on the Cyprus problrem Sir David Hannay told a news briefing. Hannay declined to go into further details. He said the issue needed what he described as \"patience and perseverence, not strokes of genius.\" He is the latest in a small army of mediators who have tried to make headway in the stalemate for the last 22 years. Turkey invaded the northern third of Cyprus in July 1974 after a Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military regime ruling in Athens at the time. Turkey now keeps 30,000 troops in the north of the island, declared a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara. Tension on the island has increased considerably in recent months with the killings of three Greek Cypriot civilians in separate incidents along the United Nations controlled buffer zone dividing the two communities. Hannay, who had separate meetings this week with Cypriot president Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, said many issues connected to the Cyprus problem came into \"sharper focus\" during his contacts. \"One is now able to see the prospect of face to face negotiations under the aegis of the U.N. in the first half of 1997 is a real prospect. Obviously there remains a lot of work to do if that prospect is to become a reality,\" he said. Hannay hedged questions on what ideas he had discussed with leaders on either side, and whether progress had been made. \"I'm satisfied the preparatory process is moving forward and that involves a process of clarification, it involves the process of probing, trying out various thoughts...it does not lend itself to a concept you would call progress.\" Earlier, Denktash told reporters the Cyprus problem could only be solved by the two sides. \"As the Turkish Cypriot side, we are ready to negotiate all subjects with the Greek Cypriot leadership,\" Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK quoted Denktash as saying. Hannay said Greece and Turkey were important elements in any solution as was Britain, which as the former colonial power on the island is also a guarantor power with the other two countries. It is Hannay's third visit to Cyprus this year. He plans to visit again in December with British foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind.\n",

      "Crisis turns to carnival in Papua New Guinea. The news came over a radio relay: after 10 days of crisis Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan was standing aside. Within seconds, turmoil and the threat of bloodshed in the tropics gave way to scenes of jubilation and an impromptu South Pacific street carnival. Thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament's gates roared their approval. Soldiers who had been blockading the building were hoisted suddenly into the air. Then came the singing -- the national anthem rang out in the pidgin language -- and chants of \"Singirok\" for sacked military commander Jerry Singirok who started the revolt over Chan's hiring of 70 foreign mercenaries to put down an island uprising. Protesters had streamed to parliament over the past two days, from around the capital and from the remote highlands and islands to demand that Chan quit. Heavily-armed troops who had besieged parliament overnight, trapping about 100 politicians, quickly piled into trucks and raced through this tropical port city, shouting, singing and flashing \"V for victory\" signs to passers-by. At Murray Barracks, the military headquarters where rebellious troops had holed up since the crisis began, soldiers fired M-16 automatic rifles into the tropical air, cheered and shook hands with civilians crowding outside the main gate. \"I feel very overwhelmed, we have won a victory. That was what we were aiming for,\" said a sergeant, part of a group of 100 soldiers celebrating as passing cars tooted their horns. \"It justifies our stand,\" he said. \"Everything is going to be okay, it's fine,\" added a man in the crowd. A group of soldiers, arranged in rows like a winning football team, posed for a victory photo for foreign media. The smallest of their number lay in front with an M-16. Other soldiers crammed into pick-up trucks and sped out of the barracks for a victory parade. Street vendors set up shops selling betel nuts, drinks, peanuts, cigarettes and chewing gum as the crowd celebrated. Port Moresby, the lush green capital, is never peaceful at the best of times -- it is known as one of the most violent cities in the world and lives under a nightly curfew. By early evening, calm had returned to the city after a revolt which could have turned tragic produced a happy ending. Despite the high emotions and hot tempers of the past 10 days, a relaxed and smiling Chan told reporters he was sure the scars would heal quickly. \"We can do miracles in this country,\" he said.\n",

      "Six to be charged after Malaysia Timor fracas. Six members of a pro-Malaysian government youth group which disrupted a meeting on East Timor a week ago will be charged in court, the national Bernama news agency reported. Quoting Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob late on Saturday, Bernama said police had completed their investigations on the six members of the People's Action Front, which broke up the Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor II (APCET II). Megat Junid did not identify the six, detail the charges or say when they would appear in court. Seven demonstrators from the group, which comprised members of Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition, were briefly detained after the fracas at a hotel in the capital in which furniture was overturned and participants manhandled. About 100 members of the group entered the hotel and stormed the conference, set to run for three days. Earlier about 1,000 anti-APCET II demonstrators had gathered outside the hotel vowing to disrupt proceedings. \"If they want to charge six people to show justice has been done, I think that's really insufficient for a case that has such a massive implication,\" said Tian Chua, one of the last 10 activists to be released and an APCET II organiser. \"We maintain that the mob that overwhelmed us was more than six people and it was a premeditated thing,\" Chua told Reuters when told about the charges. The Malaysian government had opposed the conference, fearing it would harm ties with neighbouring Indonesia, which invaded East Timor in 1975 and rules it in defiance of the United Nations. More than 100 people, including conference participants and journalists, were detained on November 9 after the aborted conference. Malaysia subsequently deported 46 foreign participants and on Thursday released the 10 remaining activists from jail. On Sunday an opinion column in Malaysia's main daily, the New Straits Times, condemned the youth group's actions. In an article headlined \"Apcet riot: An insult to civil Society\", group managing editor A. Kadir Jasin wrote: \"If the conference organisers were condemned for their disobedience, the 600-odd protesters successfully demolished whatever legitimacy they hoped to claim when some of them becamse abusive and violent.\" He added the actions by the youth group were \"not only shameful, but more significantly it showed their inability to face dissension\".\n",

      "U.S. envoy urges Serb hardliners to back down. U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard on Thursday warned Bosnian Serb hardliners led by indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic to calm their disputes with their President Biljana Plavsic and international peacekeepers. He told reporters in Belgrade after a meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that if Karadzic and his allies sought \"confrontation, they will get it... they must, must change their behaviour\". Gelbard spoke after Plavsic threatened to dissolve the Bosnian Serb parliament to prevent Karadzic and hardliners whom she has accused of corruption from using their majority to force her from power at a session scheduled for Friday. A Bosnian television report from the hardliners' stronghold in Pale, outside Sarajevo, said NATO peacekeepers had been ordered to arrest Karadzic and his wartime army commander General Ratko Mladic on sight. If confirmed, the report would signal a shift in strategy by the West which has in the past shrunk from arresting Karadzic because of the risk of renewed conflict. Gelbard is in the region to represent the five-nation Contact Group which has underwritten the Bosnian peace agreement and which tacitly sided with Plavsic on Wednesday. Gelbard did not side explicitly with Plavsic, who was democratically elected last year, but said: \"The United States supports the full implementation of the Dayton (peace) agreements and we will suport those who will carry out the Dayton agreements.\" Western countries fear the crisis between Plavsic and Karadzic, who has kept covert control of Bosnian Serb government, could derail the peace process. Gelbard was due to meet Momcilo Krajisnik, a senior Karadzic ally and Serb member of Bosnia's multi-ethnic collective presidency, later in the day. He said the activites of Karadzic, Krajisnik and Bosnian Serb police chief Dragan Kijac \"have been extremely dangerous\". Kijac's police had set up illegal roadblocks and threatened U.S. troops serving with the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) in Bosnia. Plavsic cited a constitutional crisis as the basis for a possible presidential order to dissolve the parliament, the television said. There was no comment on the letter from Plavsic's office in the northern town of Banja Luka, where policemen loyal to the president are guarding her building. British soldiers in the NATO-led peace force patrolled the streets of Banja Luka overnight to prevent violence from erupting between Plavsic's supporters, who include army generals, and Karadzic's police force. The ruling Serb Democratic Party nominated Plavsic for the presidency last year in the belief she would prove an obedient successor, but she has condemned the leadership as corrupt war profiteers. Karadzic, who led separatist Serbs during the 1992-95 war, was forced to step down from office under international pressure last year and promised to stay out of politics. Scoffing at his indictment by the U.N. war crimes tribunal, he continues to wield covert influence over his party in a bid to obstruct the peace accords. Plavsic, like Karadzic, is an ultra-nationalist ideologue but has argued for cooperating with the international community to preserve Serb interests under the U.S.-brokered peace treaty.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some strengths of the classifier model are: \n",
    "- Automate the labeling process and make the process faster when we have a lot of documents to label \n",
    "- We have a high probability of having the right label if we have a robust model with lots of training data \n",
    "- The labels can be adjusted based on the training data and preferences \n",
    "Some weaknesses of the classifier model are: \n",
    "- There might be error in the classifiers \n",
    "- The model is not robust if the proportion of error is high \n",
    "- Sometimes the actual labels are not as correct as the predicted model \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, we can use different statistical method for classification. In addition, we can also use different model technique to get the proportion of each topics instead of a single labels for each document. In addition, we can also optimize the model more to find better parameters for the model. "
